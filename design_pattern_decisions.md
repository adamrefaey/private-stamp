## Implemented Design Patterns:

### Fail early and fail loud:

check the condition(s) required for execution as early as possible and throw an exception if the condition is not met.

### Circuit Breaker:

a design pattern to allow contract functionality to be stopped.

### Restricting Access:

only owner is permitted to execute some functions.
