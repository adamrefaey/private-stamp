# PrivateStamp (Beta version)

# Currently, under active development

### A private proof-of-existence DApp.

### Prove that you've had a file (of any type & size) at a certain time without compromising your privacy.

`Currently deployed on Rinkeby network`

## Technologies used:

_Solidity_, _Hardhat_, _Typescript_, _Web Crypto API_, _React_, _ChakraUI_

## You need MetaMask extension installed to interact with the app

## Features:

### Secure:

- Your original file is never transmitted over the network, both encryption & decryption happen locally.

- Every encryption process generate a different file/hash even if the same file is encrypted with the same password, that's because a random salt is generated everytime.

### Decentralized:

- Relies on Ethereum blockchain to store/retrieve data
